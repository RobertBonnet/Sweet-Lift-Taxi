# Sweet-Lift-Taxi
This project involves building a predictive model to forecast the number of taxi orders for the next hour based on historical data collected from airports by Sweet Lift Taxi. The goal is to predict demand during peak hours and attract more drivers accordingly.

Project Description
The company Sweet Lift Taxi has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. Build a model for this prediction.

The RECM metric on the test set should not exceed 48.

Project Instructions

Download the data and resample it in such a way that each data point from the original data falls within one-hour intervals.
Analyze the data.
Train different models with different hyperparameters. The test sample should be 10% of the initial dataset.
Test the data using the test sample and provide a conclusion.
Data Description
The data is stored in the file /datasets/taxi.csv. Download the dataset.

The number of orders is in the num_orders column.
